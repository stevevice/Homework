	/*
	a. Would run
	b. Does not make sense since they are letters not numbers.
	c. Would run since it is saying it is NOT the sum of the 2 variables
	d. This factor is true because it is saying that both information must be true and it is.
	e. This doesnt make sense since 'R' doesn't have a numeric value.
	g. It wouldn't run since numPos is 35.
	h. Its adding the increment before it is used so it would be fine.
	i. It would run fine since its only adding an increment of 1 after being used.
	j. It would work since its an either or and one of the or's has been met.*/



	/*
	a. True
	b. False
	c. I think the 5 breaks this and because I do not understand what the question is asking me then i can not answer the question.
	d. True
	e. False*/
