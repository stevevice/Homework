#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	a. The first the main issue is that when we use whole numbers we use integers and when we use numbers that go on infinitely then the program
    will not read it as correclty and will just put it to a whole number
    return 0;
    b. The remainder would be changed to what ever the smaller number because when using integer you cant divide a number with another number thats larger.
    c. There is no remainder.
    d. Because of Order of Operations it will have to go left to right which means that the intended number may not correct until we use parenthesis but the answer is
    still the same no matter what way you do it. 13.5 is answer. variable needs to be a double
    e. I believe that order of operations still takes affect so the outcome might be the same as letter d. 13.5 is the answer.var needs to be a double.
    f. Answer is the same as above but with parenthesis to say what needs to be done first.
    g. The answer is 36.375 do it needs to be a double or float var.
    h. The answer is still 36.375 and the difference is the decimal after the 8 that doesn't affect anything.
    i.the answer is 0 because when both of the two's divided  each other they ended up canceling each other out.
